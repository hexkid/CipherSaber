Just (re)found out about CipherSaber at http://ciphersaber.gurus.org/

As I'm trying to get used to using git, this is my first project
created from zero with git. In fact, my first commit is going to
be this file, right after I save it HERE

Commit successfull! I had to change my name and email, but I'm
not counting that as a failure :-)

Well, then ... time to do some reading about the cipher.
No coding just right now.
